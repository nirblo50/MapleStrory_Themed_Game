This project was developed as school assignment in OOP course at "The Hebrew University of Jerusalem".
This game is an endless world game which uses reproducible randomness.
In this project we mostly focused in writing in OOP principles and using design pattrens.
This was also the first big project in shool which we did in pairs so we also tried to learn how to work 
as a team.
